Fortunately living in Atlanta, Georgia is the perfect distance away from so many nearby states. A holiday weekend approached and deciding what we should do was a small dilemma because we only had 1 night, we could spend away due to a family event that we had committed too.\nWe decided we were going to visit Lookout Mountain in Chattanooga, Tennessee. A beautiful little city only about 2 hours away from downtown Atlanta was the perfect destination. So many great activities and things to do and the perfect little getaway for the kids after a busy month at school.\nWe arrived in Chattanooga at around 11am and headed straight to Ruby Falls. Having visited Ruby Falls many times more than 7-10 years ago, and never having issues with tickets, we hadn’t bought tickets ahead of time. Our mistake ☹\n Lookout Mountain\nADVICE: Buy tickets online ahead of time especially if you are planning to visit during a holiday weekend.\nWe were not able to get tickets until 6.45pm. A bit of a long wait but for us that was ok, since we had other things we could do in between. After buying the package deal for Ruby Falls and Rock City, we started to head to Rock City.\nOn the way we came across this beautiful little cafe called Café on the Corner. It was the perfect spot to stop for brunch. The cafe is located on a Y intersection, with very tidy and clean indoor seating with lovely outdoor patio seating as well. We sat indoor due to the heat, but if it wasn’t so hot, outdoors would have been wonderful. A lot of people were sitting outdoors under the right red umbrellas.\n    CafeOnTheCorner\n      CafeOnTheCorner\n   \nThe little Cafe was very reasonable priced with many options for food to suit everyone’s taste buds. It was perfect. Chicken \u0026amp; Waffles was great for the kids, my 12-year-old loved it. The Poached Egg and Fried Green Tomato on Biscuit was fantastic. This place was a great choice for lunch. They also have $2 mimosa’s on Sunday which was a bonus on top of the great food. This is a place I would revisit next time we visit this area for sure.\n Cafe On The Corner \nCheck out some great weekend getaway  deals\nClick  for day activities \u0026amp; tours in Chattanooga\nRock City Gardens 1400 Patten Rd\nLookout Mountain, GA 30750\nWe finally made it to Rock City. Rock City Gardens is one of my favorite spots in Chattanooga located on top of Lookout Mountain. I love the fact that each corner of the park is different, they make it fun for everyone with funny little names for the different sections that make it interesting to explore. Places like the Grand Corridor, Needle’s Eye, Gnome Valley and so many more make it fun and interesting. If you’re Gnome fan, then keep your eyes wide open, there are many of them hiding amongst the different bushes and spots.\n    Rock City\n      Rock City\n      Rock City\n   \nThe park was a little busy since it was a holiday weekend and the heat was scorching, but nevertheless it was a fun afternoon in the sun. Kids loved the swing-a-long bridge and jumping on it making it shake just to scare me. They had fun with it. The pathways are so cute, it kind of makes you feel like your walking thru a fairytale. Its unique and looks so natural since everything is made from rocks.\n    High Falls\n      7 States\n      Eagle\n   \nSwinging Bridge \nThe main attraction at Rock City is the Lovers Leap. The large open area high above on top of the mountains is the perfect spot to view 7 states (Tennessee, Kentucky, Virginia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama.) This is a great hang out spot, perfect places to wait for others in your group to catch up and a great place to a bite to eat or grab an ice cream, while you enjoy the beauty of the surrounding area.\nThe Observation Point is the perfect spot to see the High Falls waterfall. Great spot for pictures and viewing point for the mountains surrounding the wonderful city. I love looking at waterfalls, they just seem so peaceful, and the sound of the water running is just so surreal.\nAfter exploring the park more we made it to the end. The kids loved this part, 12 \u0026amp; 15-year-old boys, but they loved the fairytale section, it was kind of cute, watching them singing the nursery rhymes. This section is a cavern and within the openings little stories themes have been created. Everything is lighted up so well with neon colors, and the creativity of this section is so amazing. It’s worth checking out. After going thru the cavern, you enter a large room, where an entire city is created based of different nursery rhymes and riddles. I can’t even put into words how wonderful this is, even for grownups and older kids it takes you back in the day.\nRuby Falls 1720 South Scenic Hwy\nChattanooga, TN 37409\nRubyFalls \nAfter a wonderful afternoon at Rock City, we headed back to Ruby Falls (after we freshened up at our hotel).\nI wasn’t sure if this is something the kids would like, but they loved it. They liked it more than Rock City even, but I think the heat had a lot to do with that.\nRuby Falls is great, since we had booked our time slot, we were taken in right on time. After travelling down the elevator approx. 260 ft, we entered the cave. A short history lesson later we were on our way. Even after hearing this history multiple times earlier, it’s still fascinating information, and kids were very interested in the story.\nKids learned all about stalagmites and stalactites and managed to see many of them along the way.\nRuby Falls Onyx\nThe cave is made interesting for the young and the old, as there are labels everywhere with to give you a representation of different things. Very creatively thought of, you see things like Crystal Chandeliers, a Donkey, Leaning Tower, Dragons Foot, Beehives and so much more. The whole theme of this cave is very well thought out, but especially in the holidays its best to book in advance, since the tour guide told us there are approximately 3000+ people who travel through the cave daily.\n    Ruby Falls\n      Ruby Falls\n      Ruby Falls\n   \nOf course, the highlight of the Cave is Ruby Falls. As you get closer to the end of the cave, the lights are switched off, and you enter this open area, where all you hear is the water. The lights get switched on and a breathtaking scene is in front of you. The beautiful waterfall right before your eyes, is extraordinarily perfect. You really don’t want to leave this area, but you must move on. Explorers are unsure where this water comes from, they have tried to follow the upstream flow but have been unsuccessful. Check out the history of Ruby Falls Here\nWhite Water Rafting – Ocoee River The following day before heading back home, we had bought a Groupon for White Water Rafting\n    White Water Rafting\n      White Water Rafting\n   \nThe kids had never done this before so it was a treat for them, and we had been waiting for our youngest to turn 12 before we do this, since there is an age restriction on this activity.\nKids had the thrill of their life, they sat in the front of the raft because that’s where most of the splashing happens, and we were off. 6 people on a raft and 2 kids, 1 newbie and us, it was a fun cruise down the river. We worked on spinning the raft over some high rapids, nosedived the raft (so water poured in the front), and so many other cool tricks that were up to the guides discretion Just like the other 2 places we visited the Ocoee River had names some of its rapids as well. Double Trouble, fast, Tablesaw and Hell Hole Rapid.\nThe rapids were between level 2-4, so it was a nice mix of rapids which made it fun and enjoyable without being too crazy especially for first timers and luckily no one in our raft fell out. There were several fall outs from other rafts, but no injuries. In the middle in a calm spot all the guides did stop to let people jump off the raft and enjoy the cold 65-degree water. The staff were fun, and very helpful. They made it entertaining and enjoyable for everyone there. I know for sure we will be back here again very shortly.\nOur weekend getaway was then over and we headed back home. This trip was an overnight getaway for couples of families if you are short on time, and live close to one of the neighboring states. Definitely a trip doing at least once.\nClick  for day activities \u0026amp; tours in Chattanooga\n","permalink":"https://www.skytravelblogger.com/chattanoogagetaway/","tags":["Family","Chattanooga","Lookout Mountain","Ruby Falls","Rock City","Ocoee River","White Water Rafting"],"title":"Weekend Getaway – Chattanooga, TN"},{"categories":["Europe"],"contents":" Not knowing anything besides Cambridge being a College town, we were in total love with the place. Cambridge is such a beautiful historic town, with a Royal feel to it. Its almost 2 hours away by car from Heathrow Airport, it’s very compact and cozy with many little shops and boutiques. We strolled through the streets and visited so many little stores. My cousin and her family live there, which is why we made the trip to spend time with them, but the trips was fantastic. So glad we visited\nThings to do in Cambridge    The Backs\n      Trinity College\n      Queens College\n    As we walked, we checked out many of the colleges along the way, Trinity Hall, Trinity College, Kings College.

My cousin and her family live in Cambridge so they gave us the ins and outs of the little town.\nCambridge is very scenic, with many places to see and visit. It can be covered in a day, but all depends on how much time you want to spend there, I loved the fact that the streets give you a sense of feel of inner peace and relaxation.\nWe spent a lot of time around The Backs area, it was so peaceful, and the weather was beautiful. The sun was shining, and gave a beautiful reflection on the water. The geese also made it seem to naturalistic. There were students just sitting in the lawns and studying. It was the perfect student life on campus.\n Dining Hall \n​Also, I think it must have been graduation time. There were a lot of gatherings going on inside the buildings, we even got to peak into one of the dining halls. They were setting up for an event. Not sure if we were allowed in, so we quickly strolled thru. My son managed to grab a picture though.\nPunting along the Backs The backs is known as Little Venice. Punting is a great way to see the River Cams which separates Cambridge into 2 sections.

It links the new court and the original college building of St John’s College. Its used daily by people or live or work around there. Its very similar to its name sack in Venice, Italy.\nVisit the Mathematical Bridge This is a very interesting looking bridge that connects 2 parts of Queens College together. Its official name is the “Wooden Bridge”, as its a wooden footbridge, but its derived the name of a Mathematical Bridge due to interesting situations.\n​\nThe Bridge is actually made from straight timbers, even though the shape of the bridge is an arch. Its a fairly interesting sigh as your punting down the river. Look up and review it from underneath.\n Mathematical Bridge\nTake a Cambridge University Tour You can take a University Tour, or do a Self Guided tour visiting as many or little of the University Institutions or Colleges that you like.

We had a car at our disposal which was great since there were a lot of us. We packed a picnic of sandwiches, chips and drinks and we were off. Cotswold is an not too far from Cambridge fill of scenic rolling hills. Its actually quite amazing the way the hills lay. Cotswold is made up of many tiny villages. We visited a couple of them. Both very different from each other, which gave them there own sense of uniqueness. This was a fun trip, and the kids had a place.\nBourton on the Water  Bourton On The Water\nFirst we visited Bourton on the Water, its a small village with the cutest little river going thru it.

After spending the morning in Bourton on the Water we drove to Bibury.\nI don’t think i had ever visited a village quite like this one.\n Bibury Village\nBibury is a small little town in the rural part of Cotswold.

This gorgeous island is filled with Palm trees and Coconut trees. This was a family trip with our family parents and all for as a birthday celebration for my dad who turned 70. This was a fun vacation for all there, children, us and both mine and my husband’s parents. Everyone had a great time with plenty to do for everything. Since this was a family trip and time for relaxation we mostly spent our time at the resort.

We stayed at Barcelo Bavaro Palace Deluxe, a great resort for families. The pools were beautiful, the beach was fantastic, and food was great, so many options to choose from. Many people I’m sure have destination weddings here. It’s a great place for some lovely photos. We actually saw a destination wedding happening in a little kiosk right in front of the beach. It was so beautiful. The bridal party looked wonderful in matching outfits, I’m sure there pictures come our exquisite.\nAlso the resort has so many activities for the all age groups. They had salsa lessons, aerobics on the beach (our mothers loved that), a giant chess board alongside the pool, that you can actually play, as well as other various activities. There is a schedule posted in one of the covered hang out activity areas that list what activities they are doing at what time, as well as many competitions you can compete in to win small prizes.\nThe best part of the resort was the swim up to Bars. Kids loved it because they could go order whatever they wanted and there were so many choices of non-alcoholic cocktails for them, they were in heaven.\nAlso close to the beach is a little gift shop. Looks like a hut, and very different looking. Great place to buy swim outfits, and beach gear.\n   Barcelo Beach\n      Barcelo Shopping\n      Barcelo Resort 1\n      Barcelo Games\n      Barcelo Resort 2\n      Barcelo Gazebo\n    Some of our favorite restaurants the Barcelo Bavaro were Kyoto (Japanese Restaurant that also did Hibachi), as well as Mexico Lindo.

They have outdoor activities and arcades as well as movie time for kids. My kids loved spending the time there. Also there is a water park area with a pirate ship close to the kids club. This is an additional cost (not included in the all inclusive package), if was a little secluded if you ask me, and not many people were there, but was a nice hang out place for a few hours.\n   Barcelo Kids Pool 1\n      Barcelo Pirate Ship\n      Barcelo Kids Pool 2\n    The beach water was nice and warm, only part that I didn’t like was the seaweed. I don’t like seaweed that’s washed up on shore, but once we were past that, the water was clear, blue and beautiful. We got some lively pictures from there, it was lovely. The dock was great too. It was nice to hang out at the end of the dock, and watch the boats go by smell the fresh air.\n   Barcelo Dockside\n      Barcelo Pirate Ship In The Ocean\n      Barcelo Kayak\n    Sail and Snorkel at Soana Island While in Punta Cana, we decided to do a full day excursion. After flipping some ideas around, we thought going to Saona Island would be fun. This was fantastic, definitely well worth the money and a day well spent. We absolutely love it. The trip there was on a speed boat, return was on a catamaran. You have a professional photography with you the whole time, and you will have the time of your life. We sure did.\nOn the way there we did the speed boat. They go half way to Saona Island and stop for people who want to Snorkel to allow them to Snorkel. I personally didn’t do it, but my husband and kids did. They said it was wonderful. They were surrounded by so many different kinds of fish in the water and the water was actually warm, not cold. After spending 30 minutes here, everyone got back on the boat and we moved on.\nRight before we arrived at Saona Island we stopped again, this time at the shallow turquoise waters. Here the water is literally Turquoise and not so deep. This was different.\nHere we actually got to see starfish and take pictures with them.\n   Saona Island Starfish\n      Trip To Saona Island\n      Saona Island Snorkling\n     Saona Island \nSaona Island is perfect. You wouldn’t have seen anything like it. The sand is clean and white; the water is clear and blue. Fantastic spots to take pictures and as mentioned earlier they provide a professional photograph who actually take great pictures. I’m far from a model but have to say he took some great snaps.\n​Hint: always try and negotiate on the price if you decide to buy their pictures. The island is lovely. They had great people who did great massages, which were very inexpensive. Even the kids got great massages, they loved it.\nThey provide a fantastic buffet lunch on the island, which was included in the cost of and I have to admit the food was pretty good. The photographer took some great clicks of us, that even though we weren’t wanted to buy the pictures, they were so good, we just as too.\nSalsa Lessons They had salsa lessons and performances from people working on the island.

The pools were big and clean, with nice palm trees surrounding the water, and best of all, not a mosquito in site.\nThere are so many restaurants to choose from and the food is great. Great variety of food in the buffet areas as well, as in the a la carte restaurants but you need to reserve at time check-in. Our favorite was the hibachi grill as it was the first time for the kids and my in-laws, so going through the hibachi experience was awesome. The chief was so entertaining. The buffets were good also. The changed up the food daily during dinner time so that was good, but for the picky eaters they did have the standard dishes everyday, which was great especially with kids, if they didn’t like the food at the restaurants then we had options.\n   Pool Area\n      Outdoor Seating\n      Resort Walkway\n    ​Laguna Villa at The Grand Sunset Princess Resort This trip happened to be during our 10 year anniversary. So my husband and I stayed in the Laguna Villa (which is in an adults only section of the resort), the kids stayed with my in-laws in a regular room at the resort.\nThe rooms were both very beautiful, but we loved the Laguna Villa room. It’s had a wonderful outdoor shower. I have never experienced anything like that before; it was cool, and so unique. In the first picture below is the outdoor showers behind those french doors. The top of the shower is open, so you have a natural daylight shining in. Also there is an in room Jacuzzi, right behind the bed. It’s a perfect room for a romantic getaway.\n  Adult Only Room   Outdoor Shower \n​Pool Area \u0026amp; Beach Of course the best part of the resort is the pool. They have a great swim up bar which is perfect in the hot weather. They have little sitting areas within the pool which makes it a nice place to sit and relax with a drink, or even just do some people watching.\nThey have great daytime entertainment at the resort. We had so much fun doing salsa lessons along the pool side, as well as doing pottery painting with the kids. It’s not something we had ever done before so we really enjoyed it. Always up for doing different things.\nBy the pool, after a short walk is a beautiful beach. The water is clear, calm and warm, what more can you ask for. The sand is so clean; it’s so peaceful and pleasant. Kids loved making different animals and sand castles in the sand. We all had a fantastic time, and on beach and there were so many people there. It was a great time indeed.\n   Time at the Beach\n      Time at the Beach\n      Time at the Beach\n      Time at the Beach\n      Time at the Beach\n      Time at the Beach\n    Kids Club When a break is needed from the kids, this is the perfect place to be. The kids club at this resort was fantastic. The kids worked on Art projects, to playing on the beach, to playing in the pool with the teachers and playing other outdoor sports. They even had a kids disco in the evening right before the evening shows as well as a theater and video games for older kids. Kids wanted to go there every day, and never wanted to leave.\nSome resorts ask you to pick them up for lunch, but this one provided lunch to them also, they ordered of the menu. It was great. Although we only left them there a few days during our stay since it was a family trip, but it was a nice break for them and us, and we didn\u0026rsquo;t feel guilty because they loved it.\n   Kids Club\n      Kids Club\n      Kids Club\n    ​Evenings \u0026amp; Entertainment at the Resort OMG!!! The evenings are beautiful. These pictures are from our camera and we are not professional photographers at all. The resort looks fabulous at night. Even better than the day time. With clean floors, you can literally see the shine. The trees look great against the night sky.\nWhen we go to resorts I love the evening atmosphere. One night the resort had stalls set up from multiple vendors. Vendors were selling jewelry (beaded and glass jewelry); to paintings and other art artifacts to so many other things. It was really nice and lively. Every evening they also had many different shows in the Princess theater. We saw the entertainment crew perform a Broadway Show, Grease, an International Show, Michael Jackson show and so many other shows that I don’t remember the names of. They were so entertaining and hats off to the entertainment team who work so hard during the day and finish the day off by performing for the people staying at the hotel. They really do, do a fantastic job.\n   Evenings in the Resort\n      Evenings in the Resort\n      Evenings in the Resort\n    Tulum  \n \nAfter spending so much time in a beautiful resort, who would have thought there was more beauty to see. Well I was wrong. A short bus ride away is Tulum. With ancient ruins and so much to learn about the history, it was a lovely experience. Only problem was it was way too hot, so we left a little earlier than I had hoped, but it was still a beautiful place. If you walk to the edge of the ruins, you will see the beautiful view over the ocean between the trees. The views were remarkable, and there were so many people there. Definitely a must see if you’re in that area.\nOutside of Tulum, are many little vendors selling hand crafted items, as well as performers performing little shows for the shoppers. The performers were kind of scary looking with masks and there makeup but the kids loved it.\nShopping in Riviera Maya    5th Avenue Shopping\n      5th Avenue Shopping\n      5th Avenue Shopping\n    For all females and some males, shopping is a must, even if you don’t plan to buy anything. I usually don’t buy anything outside of USA (I think everything is usually ridiculously priced), but I still like to go out and check out what a city has to offer.\nWell Riviera Maya has a beautiful market place on 5th Avenue, with lots of places to eat and a strip fill of clothing to souvenir shops. It was a nice half day excursion out of the resort. We did end up buying some souvenirs though.\nThis is a brief summary of our time in Riviera Maya, it was a wonderful trip. We loved it.\n","permalink":"https://www.skytravelblogger.com/the-grand-sunset-princess-resort-in-riviera-maya-cancun/","tags":["Beach","Mexico","Resorts","Caribbean"],"title":"The Grand Sunset Princess Resort in Riviera Maya Cancun"}]
