[{"categories":["Europe"],"contents":" Not knowing anything besides Cambridge being a College town, we were in total love with the place. Cambridge is such a beautiful historic town, with a Royal feel to it. Its almost 2 hours away by car from Heathrow Airport, it’s very compact and cozy with many little shops and boutiques. We strolled through the streets and visited so many little stores. My cousin and her family live there, which is why we made the trip to spend time with them, but the trips was fantastic. So glad we visited\nTHE TOWN OF CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY - THINGS TO DO    The Backs\n      Trinity College\n      Queens College\n    As we walked, we checked out many of the colleges along the way, Trinity Hall, Trinity College, Kings College. Even saw the Corpus Clock which was very interesting.\nWe were lucky enough to have a local tour guide with us. My cousin and her family live in Cambridge so they gave us the ins and outs of the little town.\nCambridge is very scenic, with many places to see and visit. It can be covered in a day, but all depends on how much time you want to spend there, I loved the fact that the streets give you a sense of feel of inner peace and relaxation.\nWe spent a lot of time around The Backs area, it was so peaceful, and the weather was beautiful. The sun was shining, and gave a beautiful reflection on the water. The geese also made it seem to naturalistic. There were students just sitting in the lawns and studying. It was the perfect student life on campus.\n Dining Hall \n​Also, I think it must have been graduation time. There were a lot of gatherings going on inside the buildings, we even got to peak into one of the dining halls. They were setting up for an event. Not sure if we were allowed in, so we quickly strolled thru. My son managed to grab a picture though.\nPUNTING ALONG THE BACKS The backs is known as Little Venice. Punting is a great way to see the River Cams which separates Cambridge into 2 sections. With a glass of bubbly in your hands its a great way to view the inside of many of the Colleges right from the River and see the many exotic bridges the city has to offer.​\n Punting along the Backs\nVISIT THE BRIDGE OF SIGHS This is apparently Queen Victoria’s favorite spot in Cambridge. It links the new court and the original college building of St John’s College. Its used daily by people or live or work around there. Its very similar to its name sack in Venice, Italy.\nVISIT THE MATHEMATICAL BRIDGE This is a very interesting looking bridge that connects 2 parts of Queens College together. Its official name is the “Wooden Bridge”, as its a wooden footbridge, but its derived the name of a Mathematical Bridge due to interesting situations.\n​\nThe Bridge is actually made from straight timbers, even though the shape of the bridge is an arch. Its a fairly interesting sigh as your punting down the river. Look up and review it from underneath.\n Mathematical Bridge\nTAKE A UNIVERSITY TOUR You can take a University Tour, or do a Self Guided tour visiting as many or little of the University Institutions or Colleges that you like. Each college is unique in its own way, so a pleasant afternoon to check out what each college has to offer.\n Queens College\nCorpus Christi College Corpus Christi College is a very old college.

It is Cambridge’s wealthiest college which is showcased by the annual May Ball (which is known to be one of the best parties in Britain)\nVisiting St Johns College isn’t free. Its beautiful inside but costs to get in. Founded by Lady Margaret Beaufort in 1511, mother of King Henry VII, there is her coat of arms sitting above the Tudor Great Gate on St Johns Street. This college has great detail to look out for, like statues, carved doorways …\nTrinity College Is also known as Cambridge’s Royal College. It was established in 1546 by Henry VIII, and his statue is located above the Great Gate of the College.\nPeterhouse College This college is a very small college, as well as being one of the oldest. It was founded by Peterhouse in 1284.\nSt James College This college was founded in 1511 by Henry VII’s mother, Lady Margaret Beaufort. It has a dining hall which is simply known as “The Hall”, with some fine portraits and exquisite paneling.\nPembroke College Countess of Pembroke founded this college in 1347 but many improvements of the college have been put in place since then. Pembroke has produced many bishops and poets.\nKings College Kings College is the most read about in Cambridge. Founded in 1441 by Henry VI. The Kings College Chapel is a great work of art. Its a must see when visiting Cambridge.\nFIND THE CORPUS CLOCK Lets see if you can find the Corpus Clock within the city of Cambridge. Its a beautiful invention, its mechanically controlled, no programming involved at all. You wont spend long looking at the clock but definitely nice to check out.\n Corpus Clock\nFITZWILLIAM MUSEUM This is a free museum if you like to visit museums, this one is fill of antiques, and art.\nThere are 5 areas in the museum,\n Paintings, Drawings and Prints Manuscripts and Printed Books Coins and Medals Applied Arts Antiquities  ST MARY’S CHURCH This is one of the most beautiful viewpoints of Cambridge.

Visit the inside of the Colleges (Trinity College, St Johns College, Corpus Christi College…), go Punting in the Backs, check out the coolest Mathematical Bridge and visit the Bridge of Sighs, among many other things to do in Cambridge.\nVISIT NEARLY COTSWOLD VILLAGES Cotswold for us was a day trip. We had a car at our disposal which was great since there were a lot of us. We packed a picnic of sandwiches, chips and drinks and we were off. Cotswold is an not too far from Cambridge fill of scenic rolling hills. Its actually quite amazing the way the hills lay. Cotswold is made up of many tiny villages. We visited a couple of them. Both very different from each other, which gave them there own sense of uniqueness. This was a fun trip, and the kids had a place.\nBourton on the Water  Bourton On The Water\nFirst we visited Bourton on the Water, its a small village with the cutest little river going thru it. Bourton has so many cute little tourist attractions to check out while there:\n Model Village – 1:9 replica of the village Model Railway Motoring Museum Birdland Park and Gardens (Great for kids and people who love birds) Dragon Maze Great walking Trails and Paths along the river   After strolling along the river and kids playing in the clean stream of water, we found the perfect spot to enjoy our lunch and enjoy the lively atmosphere of our surroundings. Definitely a lovely spot for relaxation and just a wonderful day out. There are some great ice cream shops right along the river too, so don’t forget to grab a cone throughout the day.\n   Bourton On The Water\n      Bourton On The Water\n      Bourton On The Water\n    Bibury Village A tiny little village in Gloucestershire, England was not a place I was expecting to spend the second part of my day. After spending the morning in Bourton on the Water we drove to Bibury.\nI don’t think i had ever visited a village quite like this one.\n Bibury Village\nBibury is a small little town in the rural part of Cotswold. If you like quiet places then this place is definitely for you. It has a nice country feel to the town, which little path ways, a stream going thru the center, and Cotswold stone cottages and walls giving the wonderful feel of the town.\nIts a wonderful place for a picnic or to pick up some small items from the village shops. The main attraction in Bibury is the Bibury Trout Farm right off the main road. Its one of the oldest trout farms in the country, and has visitors from afar.\n   Bibury Village\n      Bibury Village\n      Bibury Village\n    ","permalink":"https://travellingsky.github.io/sample-featured-post/","tags":["London"],"title":"Things to Do in Cambridge \u0026 Cotswold"},{"categories":["Caribbean Islands"],"contents":"Punta Cana in Dominican Republic who would have guessed it would be so scenic. This place is filled with Palm trees and Coconut trees. This was a family trip with our family parents and all for as a birthday celebration for my dad who turned 70. This was a fun vacation for all there, children, us and both mine and my husband’s parents. Everyone had a great time with plenty to do for everything. Since this was a family trip and time for relaxation we mostly spent our time at the resort. We stayed at Barcelo Bavaro Palace Deluxe , a great resort for families.\nPunta Cana is a place for people who love the outdoor activities. Great activities available for speed boating, catamaran sailing, , deep sea sport fishing, discovery cruises, private yachts, swimming with dolphins, snorkeling cruises, swimming with sharks and stingrays, whale watching, reef exploring and visiting small islands like Saona and Catalina.\nBarcelo Bavaro Palace Deluxe_ – All Inclusive   Barcelo Bavaro Palace Deluxe – All Inclusive \nSince this was a family trip and time for relaxation we mostly spent our time at the resort. We stayed at Barcelo Bavaro Palace Deluxe , a great resort for families. The pools were beautiful, the beach was fantastic, and food was great, so many options to choose from. Many people I’m sure have destination weddings here. It’s a great place for some lovely photos. We actually saw a destination wedding happening in a little kiosk right in front of the beach. It was so beautiful. The bridal party looked wonderful in matching outfits, I’m sure there pictures come our exquisite.\nAlso the resort has so many activities for the all age groups. They had salsa lessons, aerobics on the beach (our mothers loved that), a giant chess board alongside the pool, that you can actually play, as well as other various activities. There is a schedule posted in one of the covered hang out activity areas that list what activities they are doing at what time, as well as many competitions you can compete in to win small prizes.\nThe best part of the resort was the swim up to Bars. Kids loved it because they could go order whatever they wanted and there were so many choices of non-alcoholic cocktails for them, they were in heaven.\nAlso close to the beach is a little gift shop. Looks like a hut, and very different looking. Great place to buy swim outfits, and beach gear.\n   Barcelo Beach\n      Barcelo Shopping\n      Barcelo Resort 1\n      Barcelo Games\n      Barcelo Resort 2\n      Barcelo Gazebo\n    Some of our favorite restaurants the Barcelo Bavaro were Kyoto (Japanese Restaurant that also did Hibachi), as well as Mexico Lindo. They have 2 wonderful buffet restaurants that are open during breakfast and dinner. It’s a great for kids who can be very picky as well as when you need to feed them when restaurant reservations are late.\nThere is a special kids club at the resort for kids to spend the day especially if you want a break or some alone time. They have outdoor activities and arcades as well as movie time for kids. My kids loved spending the time there. Also there is a water park area with a pirate ship close to the kids club. This is an additional cost (not included in the all inclusive package), if was a little secluded if you ask me, and not many people were there, but was a nice hang out place for a few hours.\n   Barcelo Kids Pool 1\n      Barcelo Pirate Ship\n      Barcelo Kids Pool 2\n    The beach water was nice and warm, only part that I didn’t like was the seaweed. I don’t like seaweed that’s washed up on shore, but once we were past that, the water was clear, blue and beautiful. We got some lively pictures from there, it was lovely. The dock was great too. It was nice to hang out at the end of the dock, and watch the boats go by smell the fresh air.\n   Barcelo Dockside\n      Barcelo Pirate Ship In The Ocean\n      Barcelo Kayak\n    Saona Island While in Punta Cana, we decided to do a full day excursion. After flipping some ideas around, we thought going to Saona Island would be fun. This was fantastic, definitely well worth the money and a day well spent. We absolutely love it. The trip there was on a speed boat, return was on a catamaran. You have a professional photography with you the whole time, and you will have the time of your life. We sure did.\nOn the way there we did the speed boat. They go half way to Saona Island and stop for people who want to Snorkel to allow them to Snorkel. I personally didn’t do it, but my husband and kids did. They said it was wonderful. They were surrounded by so many different kinds of fish in the water and the water was actually warm, not cold. After spending 30 minutes here, everyone got back on the boat and we moved on. Right before we arrived at Saona Island we stopped again, this time at the shallow turquoise waters. Here the water is literally Turquoise and not so deep. This was different. Here we actually got to see starfish and take pictures with them.\n   Saona Island Starfish\n      Trip To Saona Island\n      Saona Island Snorkling\n     Saona Island \nSaona Island is perfect. You wouldn’t have seen anything like it. The sand is clean and white; the water is clear and blue. Fantastic spots to take pictures and as mentioned earlier they provide a professional photograph who actually take great pictures. I’m far from a model but have to say he took some great snaps.\n​Hint: always try and negotiate on the price if you decide to buy their pictures. The island is lovely. They had great people who did great massages, which were very inexpensive. Even the kids got great massages, they loved it.\nThey provide a fantastic buffet lunch on the island, which was included in the cost of and I have to admit the food was pretty good. The photographer took some great clicks of us, that even though we weren’t wanted to buy the pictures, they were so good, we just as too.\nThey had salsa lessons and performances from people working on the island. It was great entertainment. We had a lot of fun here, definitely worth it. There are some great opportunities for some wonderful photos even if you are not a model.\n   Palm Trees\n      Palm Trees\n      Palm Trees\n      Saona Island\n      Saona Island Shells\n      Palm Trees\n    After a wonderful day on Saona Island, the trip back to Punta Cana was the highlight. The ride back on a Catamaran with so many people was so much fun. They served beer on the ride back with music and dancing. They had some great dancers who were awesome and danced with everyone and anyone. Kids had a ball too, they were so happy. The sun beat down on us it was beautiful. Great views of the ocean, with music, such a relaxing trip back to the land. We all had a wonderful time.\nI definitely recommend this trip to anyone who is looking for a fun excursion to do from Punta Cana.

We loved it so much that we recommended it to saw many people who all went there after us.\nRight from the moment you walk into the foyer until the time you leave you feel like royalty. First we were greeted with a non alcoholic drink, which was nice and refreshing in the heat, before we even checked in for our room. The initial impression was \u0026ldquo;Wow\u0026rdquo;.\nImportant Facts about the Resort:\nThey have:\n 12 swimming pools 2 Buffet Restaurants 12 a la carte Restaurants (these require reservations as soon as\nyou get there) 17 Bars Daytime and Nighttime Entertainment Kids Club - Daytime Mini-Club (ages 4 - 12 years with swimming\npool, outdoor patio with games, House club) Kids Club - Night Entertainment for Children, Mini Disco, Mini\nTheater, Room with Video games (ages 4 - 12 years)   \nAfter checking into the hotel, we decided to take a tour. It was beautiful place and so large. The grass was green, the walkways were spotless, well maintained which made the experience so pleasant.\nThe huts were beautiful. They had little couches in there, great area to chill and relax. The pools were big and clean, with nice palm trees surrounding the water, and best of all, not a mosquito in site.\nThere are so many restaurants to choose from and the food is great. Great variety of food in the buffet areas as well, as in the a la carte restaurants but you need to reserve at time check-in. Our favorite was the hibachi grill as it was the first time for the kids and my in-laws, so going through the hibachi experience was awesome. The chief was so entertaining. The buffets were good also. The changed up the food daily during dinner time so that was good, but for the picky eaters they did have the standard dishes everyday, which was great especially with kids, if they didn’t like the food at the restaurants then we had options.\n   Pool Area\n      Outdoor Seating\n      Resort Walkway\n    ​The Room - Laguna Villa This trip happened to be during our 10 year anniversary. So my husband and I stayed in the Laguna Villa (which is in an adults only section of the resort), the kids stayed with my in-laws in a regular room at the resort.\nThe rooms were both very beautiful, but we loved the Laguna Villa room. It’s had a wonderful outdoor shower. I have never experienced anything like that before; it was cool, and so unique. In the first picture below is the outdoor showers behind those french doors. The top of the shower is open, so you have a natural daylight shining in. Also there is an in room Jacuzzi, right behind the bed. It’s a perfect room for a romantic getaway.\n  Adult Only Room   Outdoor Shower \n​Pool Area \u0026amp; Beach Of course the best part of the resort is the pool. They have a great swim up bar which is perfect in the hot weather. They have little sitting areas within the pool which makes it a nice place to sit and relax with a drink, or even just do some people watching.\nThey have great daytime entertainment at the resort. We had so much fun doing salsa lessons along the pool side, as well as doing pottery painting with the kids. It’s not something we had ever done before so we really enjoyed it. Always up for doing different things.\nBy the pool, after a short walk is a beautiful beach. The water is clear, calm and warm, what more can you ask for. The sand is so clean; it’s so peaceful and pleasant. Kids loved making different animals and sand castles in the sand. We all had a fantastic time, and on beach and there were so many people there. It was a great time indeed.\n   Time at the Beach\n      Time at the Beach\n      Time at the Beach\n      Time at the Beach\n      Time at the Beach\n      Time at the Beach\n    Kids Club When a break is needed from the kids, this is the perfect place to be. The kids club at this resort was fantastic. The kids worked on Art projects, to playing on the beach, to playing in the pool with the teachers and playing other outdoor sports. They even had a kids disco in the evening right before the evening shows as well as a theater and video games for older kids. Kids wanted to go there every day, and never wanted to leave.\nSome resorts ask you to pick them up for lunch, but this one provided lunch to them also, they ordered of the menu. It was great. Although we only left them there a few days during our stay since it was a family trip, but it was a nice break for them and us, and we didn\u0026rsquo;t feel guilty because they loved it.\n   Kids Club\n      Kids Club\n      Kids Club\n    ​Evenings \u0026amp; Entertainment at the Resort OMG!!! The evenings are beautiful. These pictures are from our camera and we are not professional photographers at all. The resort looks fabulous at night. Even better than the day time. With clean floors, you can literally see the shine. The trees look great against the night sky.\nWhen we go to resorts I love the evening atmosphere. One night the resort had stalls set up from multiple vendors. Vendors were selling jewelry (beaded and glass jewelry); to paintings and other art artifacts to so many other things. It was really nice and lively. Every evening they also had many different shows in the Princess theater. We saw the entertainment crew perform a Broadway Show, Grease, an International Show, Michael Jackson show and so many other shows that I don’t remember the names of. They were so entertaining and hats off to the entertainment team who work so hard during the day and finish the day off by performing for the people staying at the hotel. They really do, do a fantastic job.\n   Evenings in the Resort\n      Evenings in the Resort\n      Evenings in the Resort\n    Tulum  \n \nAfter spending so much time in a beautiful resort, who would have thought there was more beauty to see. Well I was wrong. A short bus ride away is Tulum. With ancient ruins and so much to learn about the history, it was a lovely experience. Only problem was it was way too hot, so we left a little earlier than I had hoped, but it was still a beautiful place. If you walk to the edge of the ruins, you will see the beautiful view over the ocean between the trees. The views were remarkable, and there were so many people there. Definitely a must see if you’re in that area.\nOutside of Tulum, are many little vendors selling hand crafted items, as well as performers performing little shows for the shoppers. The performers were kind of scary looking with masks and there makeup but the kids loved it.\nShopping    5th Avenue Shopping\n      5th Avenue Shopping\n      5th Avenue Shopping\n    For all females and some males, shopping is a must, even if you don’t plan to buy anything. I usually don’t buy anything outside of USA (I think everything is usually ridiculously priced), but I still like to go out and check out what a city has to offer.\nWell Riviera Maya has a beautiful market place on 5th Avenue, with lots of places to eat and a strip fill of clothing to souvenir shops. It was a nice half day excursion out of the resort. We did end up buying some souvenirs though.\nThis is a brief summary of our time in Riviera Maya, it was a wonderful trip. We loved it.\n","permalink":"https://travellingsky.github.io/riviera-maya-mexico/","tags":["Photos","Food","Beach","Mexico"],"title":"Riviera Maya - Mexico Vacation"}]
