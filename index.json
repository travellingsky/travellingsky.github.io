[{"categories":["General"],"contents":" How to create your own Itinerary \u0026amp; plan your next trip\nThe key to travel is Plan Plan Plan. Yes there are spontaneous people our there and that\u0026rsquo;s great if it works for you, but if your trying to travel on a budget then planning is the best way to go.\nI\u0026rsquo;m going to share with you some tips and tricks we use when traveling. I\u0026rsquo;ll update this blog as I come across more tricks, so make you you subscribe at the bottom of this blog for updates :)\nOur vacations vary from either a couples trip (my husband and I), family trip (us and our kids) or trips with friends and family. Our record has been 16 people on a trip with us (including a 2 year old baby)\n1) Choose a few destinations Are there a list of places you really want to go, but just don\u0026rsquo;t know where to start? We like to travel 1 country at a time, maybe adding a 2nd country if its going to be a short vacation to do only 1. We keep our options open.\nSo my husband and I, sit down and discuss where we would like to go next for our vacation. This is usually a general conversation over breakfast or lunch or even when we are walking outside, nothing formal.\nWe think of places where we think we may only need 5-7 days and other locations that may need more time like 10-12 days.\nThen my husband gets to work. Yes he does most of the planning, and I do the guiding or approving at the end. On the odd occasion i will look something up but I get a verbal rundown on everything so i\u0026rsquo;m generally good.\nTIP : You want to be able to book your next vacation at least 2-3 months in advance but our big vacations (10 days or more) we generally book 6 months in advance. Why so early you may ask? Because we are prepared to go on our next tour and deals area better when you book early vs book 2-3 months earlier. Also we find that most hotels are booked way out in advance in the time period we usually like to vacation, so we like to be ahead of the game.\nBook 2-3 months in advance. We book almost 6 months earlier\n2) Plan your ideal trip So once we have decided on a couple of places we would like to visit, its time to research. What is ideal for us maybe not be ideal for you, but you can give it ago. We are not big on taking tours. Til date we have only done 1 tour together which was great but it has its up\u0026rsquo;s and down\u0026rsquo;s. Check out my China Blog for our experiences on that.\nWe actually have folders we create on our desktop with plans for different countries we want to visit. In the folders we start gathering information about what there is to do in each country, what actually interests us. To help us along the way, we took at different tours that are available from different websites. We mainly look at GateOne Travels, TravelZoo tours and Costco Travels and other peoples blogs to help guide us to our ideal vacation.\nWe take the highlights from each itinerary and create our own. This way we can add or remove cities, places we are or are not interested in visiting.\nThis does take a bit of time, but once complete the hard part is done.\nSoon you will have a 10-12 day itinerary, or a 5-6 day itinerary ready to be executed, knowing how long you need in each place is important, because once the deal is available you wont have time to go and do the research then, so advance planning is key. Its less likely that you will go back to the same place again if you have only missed one or two spots so you want to cover as much as you can.\n\nIf you like relaxing vacations then, this also works, pick what is important to you and plan some quite evenings out or time at the beach. If you know what you want to do then, it becomes simple.\n3) Choose the best time for you The hard task is done. You have a few different itinerary\u0026rsquo;s, you may even have more if you have a whole list of places to visit but cant decide which one first.\nThink about which is the best time for you to take your trip, this is important so you know which dates to search for. Things about do you have hard dates you must follow, or can you adjust your schedule here or there. Our dates are usually hard dates, because of my husbands work schedule, to maximize our time off, without hurting his work schedule.\nWe take our major vacation (10-12 days) at the end of May beginning of June. Right when school is out for us here in Georgia. Kids are tired and we also need a break, but its the only real time to take such a long vacation without missing school. But others have different schedules, so think carefully about when is a good time for you to travel.\n\nWeekend vacations we like to make use of the long weekends, and my husband and I like to take our couples vacation during the second half of the year when school is on. My thinking is, if school is out then the kids should come with us. I don\u0026rsquo;t want to leave them with others when they are off, but if they are at school they are busy, so you don\u0026rsquo;t feel so guilty leaving them behind ;)\n4) Download Ebates \nBelieve me when I say to download Ebates. Originally I was a little skeptical as well, who gives you cash back for no reason right. Well wrong. To date and I have only been using Ebates for about a year or so, I\u0026rsquo;ve earned almost $1000 doing the things I would have done normally anyway. This doesn\u0026rsquo;t apply only to travel but on all online purchases I do. I will be honest, i haven\u0026rsquo;t had much luck with Ebates and Amazon, since Amazon doesn\u0026rsquo;t allow cashback on everything, but Kohl\u0026rsquo;s, Macy\u0026rsquo;s, Groupon has saved me a lot of money.\n My Ebates Returns \nWithout getting too side tracked, Ebates actually works with travel booking sites as well.\nIts very simple. All you have to do is sign up for Ebates (which is free), and download the plugin onto your internet bar at the top. You can also install the mobile app on your phone as well.\nDownside is that you have to activate the plugin each time you do a booking. If you activate it and don\u0026rsquo;t make a purchase or return a purchase you just won\u0026rsquo;t get credited, so not harm done.\nUpside is that you get free money. see above these bookings we did back in January.\nWe didn\u0026rsquo;t actually take these vacations until June and July. A few weeks after we completed these vacations, we got the credit to our account, and at the end of the quarter we received a Big Fat Check in the mail. (Yep that\u0026rsquo;s what Rakuten calls it).\nAfter experimenting with shopping, and I saw the benefits my husband is also now well training to use Ebates. Its the best app ever in my opinion and did I say its FREE.\nHow to use it \nAfter you have downloaded Ebates onto your computer, and each time you go to a website the Purple R will start flashing or a popup with display letting you know that you can activate the deal. Hit The red button to activate and your in business. Just remember make sure the button is clicked on your session for your purchase to be recorded. I always click the Purple R right before i checkout just to double check. Cos even $1 or $2 here and there actually adds up. I use the Honey App  as well but I personally like Ebates better. Try them both and see what you prefer.\n5) Bookings Book Hotels You can book hotels using Expedia, Bookings.com or Hotels.com or any other site you find, but don\u0026rsquo;t forget to active Ebates  before checking out.\nTIPS: Once you know which dates you are going to travel you can book your hotels before you even booked your flights.\nMake sure you book refundable bookings in case something changes with your dates or itinerary.\nSearch and compare the top hotels  around the world Save up to 60% off Hotels\nBook Flights Booking flights is usually a huge expense. Once again Ebates  is your friend. Ensure its active when you do your booking. Flights are usually not refundable.\nIf you book a non-direct flight then ensure you leave enough time in-between flights in case of delays.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t wait until the last minute to book your flights. Sometimes you may find a deal, but it doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean it will meet your schedule. It works for spontaneous travelers mostly. Keep your eyes open for flight deals from SkyScanneror Vayama Monitor the flights you are looking at for your destination so you know when you do come across a deal. Once you decide where you are going, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean you have to book the flight right away.\nUnited Airlines flight deals TIP: Sometimes it maybe cheaper to fly to a different city and catch a flight from there. IE: If there is a deal from Miami to Brazil, but the price from Atlanta to Brazil is much higher, look into if its cheaper to from from Atlanta to Miami to Brazil.\nI have searching for flights on a Tues, Wed or Thurs morning is cheaper than searching on other days or evenings.\nLook at one way trips to and from your destinations instead of only looking at round trips. A lot of times you will find cheaper deals.\nIf you are a spontaneous traveler then look into last minute deals. This are great if your schedule allows it.\n\nBook Tours I know i sound like a broken record and this isn\u0026rsquo;t even a sponsored blog. But i really do love Ebates . We book most of our tours using Viator. But we also activate Ebates.\nI original used Viator for the first time when i booked some tours for my Aunt and her family in Las Vegas. After that we use Viator for all our bookings we do in any country it is offered. We have used it in Las Vegas (Grand Canyon \u0026hellip;), London (Day Tour to Stonehenge, Windsor \u0026amp; Bath) \u0026amp; Italy (Pompeii, Vatican City \u0026hellip;)\n It was very simple to use and book Tickets are refundable up to a certain period before travel Book your tickets and if a 20% coupon comes up before you travel, then cancel the original booking and re-book, its that simple They have so many tours and ticketing available there is no real need to go anywhere else Service to date (completed over 20+ tours with them) have been great  TIP: Book your tour (ensure its cancel-able), then keep your eyes peeled for a coupon. The coupons don\u0026rsquo;t come out too often, but give you great savings if you are able to grab it.\n\nBook Transportation Of course once again Ebates  comes into play, if the site allows it. Some will some will not.\nNot all places you travel will require a car, so think about this carefully before you go ahead and book a car. A lot of places public transportation is sufficient and very easy to use. Trains \u0026amp; Buses in Europe are exceptional.\nTIPS: If you do book a car ensure you take up the full protection insurance. Yes it costs money but better safe than sorry. Someone is our group was glad he got the insurance after his accident.\nGet an International Drivers license. Not all countries require it, but some will not let you rent a car unless you have it.\nThese are the places we did and did not need a car\n London - Underground \u0026amp; Buses were fine Scotland - We rented a car as we were driving around the Highlands Italy - Trains were great, did not need a car at all. We did a lot of walking Ireland - We rented a car because we drove around the island. Caribbean Islands - Only need a car if you plan to travel around the Island. China - Hard to tell, we did this as part of a Tour. Greece - Only hired a car for an overnight trip to Delphi from Athens, otherwise not needed.  \nIdeally you want to cover to stay as central to most attractions as possible but also close to public transportation (like train stations). You want to have your accommodations and flights all booked well in advance of travel, and you want to have your days some what planned. We tend to book a lot in a day because we want to cover as much ground as possible, but if you like to relax, then only plan about half to three quarter days worth of stuff, so you can chill the rest of the time.\nIf you have questions or need help, feel free to reach out.

Check out our itinerary and some pointers we learnt along the way, so have a wonderful experience in London, and be able to enjoy as many of the attractions as time for you permits. Below is the itinerary we followed, feel free to modify as needed.\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\nTickets\nWe highly recommend you buy these tickets beforehand for these Attractions if you plan to visit :\n Buckingham Palace Tour Kensington Palace Tour Westminster Abbey London Eye Tower of London Madam Tussaud\u0026rsquo;s St Paul’s Cathedral Book your afternoon Tea experience And which Day tour you decide to do via Viator  Transportation\nThe easiest mode of Transportation within London is by Underground and/or Bus. If you think you are going to use the underground more than a couple of times during that particular day then a Day Pass is cheaper. Otherwise just do 1 ways or round trips.\nThe bus is actually very convenient, you have to buy a pass/card which most stores carry them. There is a $5 deposit which you get back when you return the card. Add money to the Card for the bus trips (you can use it on the underground too), and you just have to swipe it each time you catch the bus. The best part is, that any unused money on the card and the deposit is returned to you when you return the card at any location.\nGoogle Maps is your friend. As long as you have roaming, it will direct you how to get from place to place and even which underground or bus to take from where. Carry your charger with you for your phone, since this makes traveling so much easier.\nFlight deals  up to 50% off to Europe DestinationsGetting around london is one thing but with luggage is another. Get a London Airports Roundtrip - Private Transfer to London Hotel Including Return Trip\nWe stayed in the Westminster District so this itinerary is routed from there, but feel free to adjust from wherever you are staying from.\nDay 1 - Day of Arrival  Arrive in Heathrow Airport London. Check into your hotel and relax Catch the Underground to Canary Wharf  Wonder the streets and take in the beauty\nThe Jubilee Line Underground brings you straight to Canary Wharf.\nAfter spending as much time as you need at the Wharf, maybe even grabbing dinner\nRiver Thames Sunset Sightseeing Cruise\n Catch a local ferry back to Westminster. Advanced booking is generally not required but a ride down the River Thames is a great way to start your vacation in London  Day 2 - Explore the City Side of London Westminster Cathedral This is known as the Mother Church for Roman Catholics in England and Wales. Its free to stroll through the Cathedral and is very nice and peaceful in there.\nBuckingham Palace (10 Min Walk from Westminster Cathedral) Small-Group London with Changing of the Guard and Buckingham Palace Access\nfrom: Viator\nThe most famous place to visit while in London and the home to the Queen and the royal family. If timed correctly you’ll even manage to see the changing of the guards.\nWalk the Mall/ Chill at St James Park (2 Min Walk from the Palace) A wonderful 1km walk from Buckingham Palace up to Trafalgar Square through the Admiralty Arch passing the St James Park on the way. If you have time, I highly recommend spending a bit of time relaxing on the lawns of the Park, it’s a nice resting spot and place to chill for a bit.\nTrafalgar Square (\u0026lt; 10 Min Walk from St James Park) Located at the entrance to the Admiralty Arch, surrounded by many museums, shops and restaurants this is a place you can easy spend a bit of time. Also a great stop to grab a bit to eat. Its about a 1km walk from Buckingham Palace up the Mall, to a huge opening.\nHyde Park (30 Min Walk or Catch the underground Charing Cross to Hyde Park Corner) After spending time at Trafalgar Square either walk or catch the underground to Hyde Park. A regular bus will also take you there. From the corner of the park you can explore the left and right side of the park, as each side has its own things to offer.\nHarrods (About a 5 Min Walk) Million Square Feet of retail space to shop until you drop. Harrods has over 330 stores, cafes and restaurants inside, and all the brands your heart desires. Worth checking out especially because this is where all the celebrities love to shop.\nKensington Palace / Kensington Gardens (28 Min Walk or Uber/Bus Ride to the Palace) Kensington Palace Entrance Ticket\nfrom: Viator\nThe current Royal residence for the Duke \u0026amp; Duchess of Cambridge (Prince William \u0026amp; Kate). Lovely gardens surround this palace, and for those interested you can check out the inside of the palace with a purchase of a ticket and see some of Queen Victoria’s childhood in the exhibitions they have there.\nDay 3 - Explore the River Thames Area of London Westminster Abbey Westminster Abbey Entrance Ticket Including Audio Guide\nfrom: Viator\nStart the day out at Westminster Abbey. Highly recommended you buy tickets online before hand if you plan to take a tour of the abbey. Here was a 2 hour wait when we got there first thing in the morning. This is the Abbey where some of the big Royal Weddings, Coronations have happened. It is also where the Queen \u0026amp; Prince Phillip as well as Prince William and Princess Kate got married.\nParliament Square (\u0026lt; 5 mins walking) Only a hop skip away from Westminster Abbey, is the home of the members of parliament. Its an iconic spot in London that you can really miss.\nBig Ben (\u0026lt; 5 mins walking) The Big Ben is located on the north corner of the House of Parliament. Its is located in the Elizabeth Tower overlooking the River Thames. Currently under refurbishment, but will be open in 2021. Currently you can see the clock thru the scaffolding, but because Parliament and the Big Ben are under construction its not really that impressive in my opinion. Will be nice when complete though.\nLondon Eye (10 Min Walk from Big Ben) London Eye Skip-the-Line Ticket\nfrom: Viator\nCross over the bridge and as you observe the beauty of the river, you will see the London Eye in front of you on the left. Not far from the Big Ben is the wheel that will give you a 360-degree view of London’s skyline. We were short on time and lots to cover so we purchased the fast-track tickets and we didn’t have to wait too London to see the views from the skyline.\nMillennium Bridge (20 Min Walk from London Eye) A beautiful walk down the Southbank along the River Thames to the Millennium Bridge is just what you need on a beautiful afternoon. This is an extraordinary looking footbridge, it’s a steel suspension bridge for pedestrians to cross the River Thames in London.\nLondon Bridge (15 Min Walk) You won’t need much time here. The London Bridge is not the Tower Bridge as it confused most. This bridge is on the way to the Tower Bridge which covers the current crossing of the City of London and Southwark.\nTower Bridge (15 Min Walk) Tower of London and Tower Bridge Walking Tour\nfrom: Viator\nFor us this was the highlight of our time in London. The Tower Bridge is just as beautiful if not more in real life than on TV. The large bridge is breathtaking, and with stunning that words cannot describe.\nTours can be taken of the towers of the tower bridge. We did not do it, but tickets are available for those interested. The bridge also opens up to large boats that travel the River Thames, so if you are able to catch that iconic moment its remarkable.\nSpend a few hours hanging out on the lawns on the Southbank side of the bridge. For us it was a wonderful relaxing afternoon.\nDay 4 Check out my Blog Post on things to do in London to learn more about our trip or there are many 1 day tours to pick from and it’s a nice time away so you can come back finish off what your missed seeing.\nPrivate Full Day tour of Windsor Stonehenge and Bath from London\nThis one above is the tour we took and loved it. Below are other options to look into:\nPrivate Full-Day Tour of Stonehenge and Bath from London\nLeeds Castle, Canterbury Cathedral, Dover and Greenwich with Thames River Cruise Tour from London\nDont forget to check out the Harry Potter Tours while your here for all the Harry Potter Fans\n\n  shrsl_ShareASale_liveWid_Init(34166, 2167244, 'shrsl_ShareASale_liveWid_leaderBoard_populate'); \nDay 5 - this is essential the day to finish off anything you missed. Madame Tussaud\u0026rsquo;s London (We did not do these since we have seen it elsewhere, and we were short on time) Madame Tussauds London Priority Entrance Ticket Including Star Wars Exhibition\nfrom: Viator\nThis museum has now become a chain, but it’s a fun walk thru to check out many famous live like statues and great place to take pictures with wax figured celebrities. The old and young both have fun with it.\nTower of London (Bus or Uber ride or Underground from Madame Tussaud\u0026rsquo;s) Tower of London Entrance Ticket Including Crown Jewels and Beefeater Tour\nfrom: Viator\nThis is a distance from Madame Tussaud\u0026rsquo;s but you most likely won’t have enough time on Day 3 to complete this, so we had to push it out to our left-over day.\nI personally didn’t know anything about the Tower of London. I didn’t think much off it, but boy was I wrong. The exterior and village surrounding the Tower of London is lovely, but after you walk inside its like visiting a whole new town.\nYou will be able to view the Crown Jewels, the Royal Mint, and so many other interesting breathtaking sections, even the kids were all intrigued.\nAfternoon Tea at the Swan (25 Min Walk from Tower of London) Grand Afternoon Tea at Shakespeare’s Globe after a full-on morning at the Tower of London, is what we needed. A variety of teas to choose from, as well as an option for Mimosa’s in the afternoon with a nice selection of Pastries, sandwiches and desserts to push us thru the afternoon.\nSt Paul’s Cathedral (25 Min Walk from Tower of London or 11 Mins Walk from The Swan) This is an Anglican Cathedral, and the seat of the Bishop of London. It as the highest point of the City of London and has held many funerals and weddings of people. Prince Charles and Princess Diana got married there.\nNOTE: You may not have enough time to do all of this on Day 5, because Tower of London takes a bit of time, so pick and choose carefully what you decide is important to you. We did the Tower of London, Afternoon Tea and decided to spend the afternoon on the lawns in front of the Tower Bridge because we were not interested in Madame Tussauds and we didn’t have enough time to go to the Cathedral.\n\n  shrsl_ShareASale_liveWid_Init(34164, 2167244, 'shrsl_ShareASale_liveWid_leaderBoard_populate'); \n","permalink":"https://www.skytravelblogger.com/5-day-london-itinerary/","tags":["London","London City","River Thames","Buckingham Palace","Royal Parks","Canary Wharf","Westminster Cathedral","Itinerary"],"title":"5 Day - London Itinerary"},{"categories":["Europe"],"contents":" London the city of dreams.

So, what is there to do in Canary wharf, there are many restaurants, gardens, museums all worth checking out. There are many events that happen at Canary Wharf, they have great venues for these events.\n   Canary Wharf\n      Canary Wharf Gardens\n    2) Westminster Cathedral The Westminster Cathedral  is where the seat of the Cardinal Archbishop of Westminster is located and it’s also known as the Mother Church for Roman Catholics of Wales and England. The Cathedral is free to visit and worth checking out. It has beautiful high altars and grand mosaics inside. The chapel of the Blessed Sacrament is on the north side of the sanctuary, and the Lady Chapel on the south.\n   Westminster Cathedral\n      Westminster Cathedral\n    Its also a great place to sit and chill with a cup of coffee\n Chilling outside the Cathedral \nHalf-Day London Tour: Westminster Abbey and Houses of Parliament\nfrom: Viator\n3) Buckingham Palace \u0026amp; Changing of the Guard The home of the Queen and the Royal family. The Buckingham Palace  you have to see while visiting London. Its mostly crowded with people but never the less checking out this palace is a must see in London. There are also tours available if interested in going inside. Tours of the interior of the palace is only available in the summer from late July until the end of September which the queen is on holiday in Scotland. If the Royal Standard Flag is flying that means the queen is in residences. If its not flying then the Union Jack is flown.\n   Buckingham Palace\n      Buckingham Palace\n    The changing of the Guards Ceremony happens daily at 11.30am when the Royal Guards change shifts.\nLondon Combo: Westminster Abbey with Changing of the Guard, Buckingham Palace and Afternoon Tea\n4) The Mall The Mall is a ceremonial road from Trafalgar Square leading straight to Buckingham Palace. You go through the Admiralty Arch passing Clarence House on the way. The walk is about 1km walk but it’s beautiful like walking on a red carpet. Its used for most royal processions and celebrations. Head of State are often escorted on horse and carriages up the Mall decorated with the Union Flags and flags from visiting head of state countries.\n   The Mall\n      Admiralty Arch\n    5) St James Park This park is located right between Trafalgar Square and Buckingham palace. It’s a great spot if you want to chill and relax or kids want to ran around a bit. For people who love the nature it’s a nice spot to sit and read a book and take in the scenery.\n View from St James Park \n6) Trafalgar Square Trafalgar Square  is located in the middle of the city, right at the entrance to The Mall where the Royal Processions go thru. There are so many museums and shops around this popular area, but the center piece of Trafalgar Square is the Fountains and Statue in the center. The Columns \u0026amp; Statue were designed to honour Admiral Nelson, after his victory in the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805 and the lions were designed to protect the Columns.\n Trafalgar Square \n7) Hyde Park London has many large parks, and Hyde Park is another one of them. Great place to relax and enjoy the sun. The park is used for many events so check the calendar to make sure the park isn’t taken over by events. We did have a triathlon going on the day we went so that sort of ruined it for us, but never the less it was still very beautiful if there weren’t as many people around.\n Hyde Park \nI personally loved Princess Diana, so I wanted to check out the Diana Memorial Fountain while I was there\n8) Harrods Harrods is a large department store with over 330 branded stores, coffee shops and restaurants. You can easily spend a day here if you love all the brands. For us we had kids and the husbands so we weren’t able to spend too long here as they were all getting antsy, but the store is unique, it has a very classy feel to it.\nYou can find branded bags, purses, accessories, clothing, boots, food \u0026amp; wine whatever you desire if your wallet can afford it.\nThe store has over 1.1 million square feet of retail space and is the largest department store in Europe. It even has its own Zipcode which I think is interesting.\nThere is a dress code to shop at Harrods though. There have been celebrities that have been banned from the store for not complying.\nNOTE: Forbidden items include uniforms; cycling shorts; high-cut shorts, Bermuda or beach shorts; swimwear; athletic singlets; flip flops or thong sandals; bare feet; bare midriff; or wearing dirty or unkempt clothing.\n9) Kensington Palace/Kensington Gardens This was the birthplace for Queen Victoria and the home of many of the Royal family members over the years. Currently the palace is the official residence for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge (Prince William \u0026amp; Kate) and their children. You are allowed to visit the inside of the palace (buying the tickets before hand is highly recommended though). You can visit the right side of the palace along with the display areas, and state rooms as well as visit some of Queen Victoria’s exhibits. Kensington Garden is part of the palace surrounding the outer rim of the palace. Grand lake and ducks and birds love to hand out there. Is a nice walk with a great little coffee shop right at the start of the gardens overlooking the lake.\n   Kensington Palace\n      Kensington Palace\n      Kensington Garden Baby Ducks\n      Kensington Gardens Bar\n    10) Westminster Abbey This is where it all happens. The Westminster Abbey is located very close to the Buckingham Palace and its where most of the big ceremony’s take place, whether it’s a Royal Wedding, Coronations, such big royal events. The Queen \u0026amp; Prince Phillip got married at Westminster Abbey as well as Prince William and Princess Kate. The Abbey is a Gothic church and has rules that only people allowed to marry in the Abbey are members of the royal family, members of the Order of the Bath and their children and anyone who lives in the Abbey’s precincts. So, weddings here are very rare, but when they happen, they are very special.\nWestminster Abbey \nThe Abbey also has a burial ground next to it, where some of the Monarch is buried, others are buried in Frogmore in Windsor.\n11) Parliament Square Located minutes away from Westminster Abbey, this home of parliament in central London is a beautifully structured building, which embraces statues of 12 statesmen and other notable people in parliament. Many demonstrations and protests occur here also. You will find statues of people like Winston Churchill, David Lloyd George, Jan Smuts, Henry John Temple, Edward Smith-Stanley, Benjamin Disraeli, Sir Robert Peel, George Canning, Abraham Lincoln, Nelson Mandela, Mahatma Gandhi \u0026amp; Millicent Fawcett.\nParliament Square\n12) Big Ben Big Ben is actually called the Great Bell of the Clock, also known as the Clock Tower. Currently the clock is under construction as well as Parliament House but the face of the clock is still visible between the scaffolding. Tours of Big Ben are usually available but are currently suspended due to refurbishment. They are schedule to start back up in 2021.\nBig Ben Currently under Construction\n13) Coca-Cola London Eye You must buy tickets to ride the London Eye, but it’s the best way to see the skyline of the City of London. Located on the South Bank of the River Thames, it has become London’s most famous attraction. The London Eye stands 135 metres high of the group and allows you a great 25-kilometer view in every direction.\n   London Eye\n      London Eye\n      London Eye\n      London Eye\n    London Day Tour Including London Eye OR London Eye Skip-the-Line Ticket\n14) Millennium Bridge This bridge is officially called the London Millennium Footbridge because its is a steel suspension bridge for people who want to cross the River Thames. The bridge is great access from the south bank to the north bank from the Shakespeare’s Globe to the St Paul’s Cathedral. The bridge looks really cool and the structure of it is unique.\nMillennium Bridge\n15) London Bridge The London Bridge often is confused with the Tower Bridge, but they look completely different. What we usually see in movies in the Tower Bridge. The London bridge is located not far from The Shard which is the tallest building in Europe.\n16) Tower Bridge Tower Bridge is the icon of London. When London is shown in a movie, the first scene usually is of the Tower Bridge. Its 125 years old, and lights up like Disneyland at night.\nComplete with Glass Flooring and tours available of the Towers on the bridge which takes you inside to show the engineering rooms and history of the bridge.\n   Tower Bridge\n      Tower Bridge\n    Tower Bridge\nThe bridge opens to incoming boards on the River Thames, and traffic stops on both sides to let the boats pass through. It’s a beautiful site to see it all in motion.\n17) Tower of London This is the official Her Majesty’s Royal Palace and Fortress. It’s a historic castle located on the north bank of the River Thames. Make sure you book your tickets to tour the castle, I personally wasn’t that interested in it, but boy was I wrong. I really enjoyed the inside tour.

Let’s just say 4 stories of shopping, we ran out of time. 4 Girls had a blast and bought so many things at great prices, that we had to revisit the store in Scotland, to buy more stuff.

Fortunately living in Atlanta, Georgia is the perfect distance away from so many nearby states. A holiday weekend approached and deciding what we should do was a small dilemma because we only had 1 night, we could spend away due to a family event that we had committed too.\nWe decided we were going to visit Lookout Mountain in Chattanooga, Tennessee. A beautiful little city only about 2 hours away from downtown Atlanta was the perfect destination. So many great activities and things to do and the perfect little getaway for the kids after a busy month at school.\nWe arrived in Chattanooga at around 11am and headed straight to Ruby Falls. Having visited Ruby Falls many times more than 7-10 years ago, and never having issues with tickets, we hadn’t bought tickets ahead of time. Our mistake ☹\n Lookout Mountain\nADVICE: Buy tickets online ahead of time especially if you are planning to visit during a holiday weekend.\nWe were not able to get tickets until 6.45pm. A bit of a long wait but for us that was ok, since we had other things we could do in between. After buying the package deal for Ruby Falls and Rock City, we started to head to Rock City.\nOn the way we came across this beautiful little cafe called Café on the Corner. It was the perfect spot to stop for brunch. The cafe is located on a Y intersection, with very tidy and clean indoor seating with lovely outdoor patio seating as well. We sat indoor due to the heat, but if it wasn’t so hot, outdoors would have been wonderful. A lot of people were sitting outdoors under the right red umbrellas.\n    CafeOnTheCorner\n      CafeOnTheCorner\n   \nThe little Cafe was very reasonable priced with many options for food to suit everyone’s taste buds. It was perfect. Chicken \u0026amp; Waffles was great for the kids, my 12-year-old loved it. The Poached Egg and Fried Green Tomato on Biscuit was fantastic. This place was a great choice for lunch. They also have $2 mimosa’s on Sunday which was a bonus on top of the great food. This is a place I would revisit next time we visit this area for sure.\n Cafe On The Corner \nCheck out some great weekend getaway  deals\nClick  for day activities \u0026amp; tours in Chattanooga\nRock City Gardens 1400 Patten Rd\nLookout Mountain, GA 30750\nWe finally made it to Rock City. Rock City Gardens is one of my favorite spots in Chattanooga located on top of Lookout Mountain. I love the fact that each corner of the park is different, they make it fun for everyone with funny little names for the different sections that make it interesting to explore. Places like the Grand Corridor, Needle’s Eye, Gnome Valley and so many more make it fun and interesting. If you’re Gnome fan, then keep your eyes wide open, there are many of them hiding amongst the different bushes and spots.\n    Rock City\n      Rock City\n   \nThe park was a little busy since it was a holiday weekend and the heat was scorching, but nevertheless it was a fun afternoon in the sun. Kids loved the swing-a-long bridge and jumping on it making it shake just to scare me. They had fun with it. The pathways are so cute, it kind of makes you feel like your walking thru a fairytale. Its unique and looks so natural since everything is made from rocks.\n    High Falls\n      7 States\n   \nSwinging Bridge \nThe main attraction at Rock City is the Lovers Leap. The large open area high above on top of the mountains is the perfect spot to view 7 states (Tennessee, Kentucky, Virginia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama.) This is a great hang out spot, perfect places to wait for others in your group to catch up and a great place to a bite to eat or grab an ice cream, while you enjoy the beauty of the surrounding area.\nThe Observation Point is the perfect spot to see the High Falls waterfall. Great spot for pictures and viewing point for the mountains surrounding the wonderful city. I love looking at waterfalls, they just seem so peaceful, and the sound of the water running is just so surreal.\nAfter exploring the park more we made it to the end. The kids loved this part, 12 \u0026amp; 15-year-old boys, but they loved the fairytale section, it was kind of cute, watching them singing the nursery rhymes. This section is a cavern and within the openings little stories themes have been created. Everything is lighted up so well with neon colors, and the creativity of this section is so amazing. It’s worth checking out. After going thru the cavern, you enter a large room, where an entire city is created based of different nursery rhymes and riddles. I can’t even put into words how wonderful this is, even for grownups and older kids it takes you back in the day.\nRuby Falls 1720 South Scenic Hwy\nChattanooga, TN 37409\nRubyFalls \nAfter a wonderful afternoon at Rock City, we headed back to Ruby Falls (after we freshened up at our hotel).\nI wasn’t sure if this is something the kids would like, but they loved it. They liked it more than Rock City even, but I think the heat had a lot to do with that.\nRuby Falls is great, since we had booked our time slot, we were taken in right on time. After travelling down the elevator approx. 260 ft, we entered the cave. A short history lesson later we were on our way. Even after hearing this history multiple times earlier, it’s still fascinating information, and kids were very interested in the story.\nKids learned all about stalagmites and stalactites and managed to see many of them along the way.\nRuby Falls Onyx\nThe cave is made interesting for the young and the old, as there are labels everywhere with to give you a representation of different things. Very creatively thought of, you see things like Crystal Chandeliers, a Donkey, Leaning Tower, Dragons Foot, Beehives and so much more. The whole theme of this cave is very well thought out, but especially in the holidays its best to book in advance, since the tour guide told us there are approximately 3000+ people who travel through the cave daily.\n    Ruby Falls\n      Ruby Falls\n   \nOf course, the highlight of the Cave is Ruby Falls. As you get closer to the end of the cave, the lights are switched off, and you enter this open area, where all you hear is the water. The lights get switched on and a breathtaking scene is in front of you. The beautiful waterfall right before your eyes, is extraordinarily perfect. You really don’t want to leave this area, but you must move on. Explorers are unsure where this water comes from, they have tried to follow the upstream flow but have been unsuccessful. Check out the history of Ruby Falls Here\nWhite Water Rafting – Ocoee River The following day before heading back home, we had bought a Groupon for White Water Rafting\n    White Water Rafting\n      White Water Rafting\n   \nThe kids had never done this before so it was a treat for them, and we had been waiting for our youngest to turn 12 before we do this, since there is an age restriction on this activity.\nKids had the thrill of their life, they sat in the front of the raft because that’s where most of the splashing happens, and we were off. 6 people on a raft and 2 kids, 1 newbie and us, it was a fun cruise down the river. We worked on spinning the raft over some high rapids, nosedived the raft (so water poured in the front), and so many other cool tricks that were up to the guides discretion Just like the other 2 places we visited the Ocoee River had names some of its rapids as well. Double Trouble, fast, Tablesaw and Hell Hole Rapid.\nThe rapids were between level 2-4, so it was a nice mix of rapids which made it fun and enjoyable without being too crazy especially for first timers and luckily no one in our raft fell out. There were several fall outs from other rafts, but no injuries. In the middle in a calm spot all the guides did stop to let people jump off the raft and enjoy the cold 65-degree water. The staff were fun, and very helpful. They made it entertaining and enjoyable for everyone there. I know for sure we will be back here again very shortly.\nOur weekend getaway was then over and we headed back home. This trip was an overnight getaway for couples of families if you are short on time, and live close to one of the neighboring states. Definitely a trip doing at least once.\nClick  for day activities \u0026amp; tours in Chattanooga\nDont forget to check out my other blog 10 Fun Things To Do in Chattanooga\n\n","permalink":"https://www.skytravelblogger.com/chattanoogagetaway/","tags":["Family","Chattanooga","Lookout Mountain","Ruby Falls","Rock City","Ocoee River","White Water Rafting"],"title":"Weekend Getaway – Chattanooga, TN"},{"categories":["Europe"],"contents":" Not knowing anything besides Cambridge being a College town, we were in total love with the place. Cambridge is such a beautiful historic town, with a Royal feel to it. Its almost 2 hours away by car from Heathrow Airport, it’s very compact and cozy with many little shops and boutiques.

It’s a great for kids who can be very picky as well as when you need to feed them when restaurant reservations are late.\nThere is a special kids club at the resort for kids to spend the day especially if you want a break or some alone time. They have outdoor activities and arcades as well as movie time for kids. My kids loved spending the time there. Also there is a water park area with a pirate ship close to the kids club. This is an additional cost (not included in the all inclusive package), if was a little secluded if you ask me, and not many people were there, but was a nice hang out place for a few hours.\n   Barcelo Kids Pool 1\n      Barcelo Pirate Ship\n    The beach water was nice and warm, only part that I didn’t like was the seaweed. I don’t like seaweed that’s washed up on shore, but once we were past that, the water was clear, blue and beautiful. We got some lively pictures from there, it was lovely. The dock was great too. It was nice to hang out at the end of the dock, and watch the boats go by smell the fresh air.\n   Barcelo Dockside\n      Barcelo Pirate Ship In The Ocean\n    Sail and Snorkel at Soana Island Saona Island Day Trip From Punta Cana\nfrom: Viator\nWhile in Punta Cana, we decided to do a full day excursion. After flipping some ideas around, we thought going to Saona Island would be fun. This was fantastic, definitely well worth the money and a day well spent. We absolutely love it. The trip there was on a speed boat, return was on a catamaran. You have a professional photography with you the whole time, and you will have the time of your life. We sure did.\nOn the way there we did the speed boat. They go half way to Saona Island and stop for people who want to Snorkel to allow them to Snorkel. I personally didn’t do it, but my husband and kids did. They said it was wonderful. They were surrounded by so many different kinds of fish in the water and the water was actually warm, not cold. After spending 30 minutes here, everyone got back on the boat and we moved on.\nRight before we arrived at Saona Island we stopped again, this time at the shallow turquoise waters. Here the water is literally Turquoise and not so deep. This was different.\nHere we actually got to see starfish and take pictures with them.\n   Saona Island Starfish\n      Saona Island Snorkling\n    Saona Island is perfect. You wouldn’t have seen anything like it. The sand is clean and white; the water is clear and blue. Fantastic spots to take pictures and as mentioned earlier they provide a professional photograph who actually take great pictures. I’m far from a model but have to say he took some great snaps.\n​Hint: always try and negotiate on the price if you decide to buy their pictures. The island is lovely. They had great people who did great massages, which were very inexpensive. Even the kids got great massages, they loved it.\nThey provide a fantastic buffet lunch on the island, which was included in the cost of and I have to admit the food was pretty good. The photographer took some great clicks of us, that even though we weren’t wanted to buy the pictures, they were so good, we just as too.\nSalsa Lessons They had salsa lessons and performances from people working on the island. It was great entertainment. We had a lot of fun here, definitely worth it. There are some great opportunities for some wonderful photos even if you are not a model.\n   Palm Trees\n      Palm Trees\n      Palm Trees\n      Saona Island\n      Saona Island Shells\n      Palm Trees\n    After a wonderful day on Saona Island, the trip back to Punta Cana was the highlight. The ride back on a Catamaran with so many people was so much fun. They served beer on the ride back with music and dancing. They had some great dancers who were awesome and danced with everyone and anyone. Kids had a ball too, they were so happy. The sun beat down on us it was beautiful. Great views of the ocean, with music, such a relaxing trip back to the land. We all had a wonderful time.\nI definitely recommend this trip to anyone who is looking for a fun excursion to do from Punta Cana. It was lots of fun, and well worth it.\n   Fun on the Catamaran\n      Fun on the Catamaran\n      Fun on the Catamaran\n      Fun on the Catamaran\n      Fun on the Catamaran\n      Fun on the Catamaran\n    ","permalink":"https://www.skytravelblogger.com/10-fun-things-to-do-in-punta-cana/","tags":["Caribbean","Beach"],"title":"10 Fun Things To Do in Punta Cana"},{"categories":["Caribbean Islands"],"contents":" Picking the right resort is essential when vacationing, and for us the \u0026lt;Princess Punta Cana Hotels\u0026gt;Grand Sunset Princess Resort was perfect. We loved it so much that we recommended it to saw many people who all went there after us.\nRight from the moment you walk into the foyer until the time you leave you feel like royalty. First we were greeted with a non alcoholic drink, which was nice and refreshing in the heat, before we even checked in for our room. The initial impression was \u0026ldquo;Wow\u0026rdquo;.\nHotel Grand Sunset Princess\nfrom: Princess Hotels\nImportant Facts about the Grand Sunset Princess Resort The Grand Sunset Princess resort in Riviera Maya consists of:\n 12 swimming pools 2 Buffet Restaurants 12 a la carte Restaurants (these require reservations as soon as\nyou get there) 17 Bars Daytime and Nighttime Entertainment Kids Club - Daytime Mini-Club (ages 4 - 12 years with swimming\npool, outdoor patio with games, House club) Kids Club - Night Entertainment for Children, Mini Disco, Mini\nTheater, Room with Video games (ages 4 - 12 years)      Barcelo Bavaro Deluxe View\n      Barcelo Bavaro Deluxe Lobby\n   \nAfter checking into the hotel, we decided to take a tour. It was beautiful place and so large. The grass was green, the walkways were spotless, well maintained which made the experience so pleasant.\nThe huts were beautiful. They had little couches in there, great area to chill and relax. The pools were big and clean, with nice palm trees surrounding the water, and best of all, not a mosquito in site.\nThere are so many restaurants to choose from and the food is great. Great variety of food in the buffet areas as well, as in the a la carte restaurants but you need to reserve at time check-in. Our favorite was the hibachi grill as it was the first time for the kids and my in-laws, so going through the hibachi experience was awesome. The chief was so entertaining. The buffets were good also. The changed up the food daily during dinner time so that was good, but for the picky eaters they did have the standard dishes everyday, which was great especially with kids, if they didn’t like the food at the restaurants then we had options.\n   Pool Area\n      Outdoor Seating\n    ​Laguna Villa at The Grand Sunset Princess Resort Hotel Grand Sunset Princess\nfrom: Princess Hotels\nThis trip happened to be during our 10 year anniversary. So my husband and I stayed in the Laguna Villa (which is in an adults only section of the resort), the kids stayed with my in-laws in a regular room at the resort.\nThe rooms were both very beautiful, but we loved the Laguna Villa room. It’s had a wonderful outdoor shower. I have never experienced anything like that before; it was cool, and so unique. In the first picture below is the outdoor showers behind those french doors. The top of the shower is open, so you have a natural daylight shining in. Also there is an in room Jacuzzi, right behind the bed. It’s a perfect room for a romantic getaway.\n  Adult Only Room   Outdoor Shower \n​Pool Area \u0026amp; Beach Of course the best part of the resort is the pool. They have a great swim up bar which is perfect in the hot weather. They have little sitting areas within the pool which makes it a nice place to sit and relax with a drink, or even just do some people watching.\nLuxury Sailing and Snorkeling in the Riviera Maya Including Lunch\nfrom: Viator\nThey have great daytime entertainment at the resort. We had so much fun doing salsa lessons along the pool side, as well as doing pottery painting with the kids. It’s not something we had ever done before so we really enjoyed it. Always up for doing different things.\nBy the pool, after a short walk is a beautiful beach. The water is clear, calm and warm, what more can you ask for. The sand is so clean; it’s so peaceful and pleasant. Kids loved making different animals and sand castles in the sand. We all had a fantastic time, and on beach and there were so many people there. It was a great time indeed.\n   Time at the Beach\n      Time at the Beach\n      Time at the Beach\n      Time at the Beach\n      Time at the Beach\n      Time at the Beach\n    Kids Club When a break is needed from the kids, this is the perfect place to be. The kids club at this resort was fantastic. The kids worked on Art projects, to playing on the beach, to playing in the pool with the teachers and playing other outdoor sports. They even had a kids disco in the evening right before the evening shows as well as a theater and video games for older kids. Kids wanted to go there every day, and never wanted to leave.\nSome resorts ask you to pick them up for lunch, but this one provided lunch to them also, they ordered of the menu. It was great. Although we only left them there a few days during our stay since it was a family trip, but it was a nice break for them and us, and we didn\u0026rsquo;t feel guilty because they loved it.\n   Kids Club\n      Kids Club\n    ​Evenings \u0026amp; Entertainment at the Resort OMG!!! The evenings are beautiful. These pictures are from our camera and we are not professional photographers at all. The resort looks fabulous at night. Even better than the day time. With clean floors, you can literally see the shine. The trees look great against the night sky.\nWhen we go to resorts I love the evening atmosphere. One night the resort had stalls set up from multiple vendors. Vendors were selling jewelry (beaded and glass jewelry); to paintings and other art artifacts to so many other things. It was really nice and lively. Every evening they also had many different shows in the Princess theater. We saw the entertainment crew perform a Broadway Show, Grease, an International Show, Michael Jackson show and so many other shows that I don’t remember the names of. They were so entertaining and hats off to the entertainment team who work so hard during the day and finish the day off by performing for the people staying at the hotel. They really do, do a fantastic job.\n   Evenings in the Resort\n      Evenings in the Resort\n    Tulum  \n \nAfter spending so much time in a beautiful resort, who would have thought there was more beauty to see. Well I was wrong. A short bus ride away is Tulum. With ancient ruins and so much to learn about the history, it was a lovely experience. Only problem was it was way too hot, so we left a little earlier than I had hoped, but it was still a beautiful place. If you walk to the edge of the ruins, you will see the beautiful view over the ocean between the trees. The views were remarkable, and there were so many people there. Definitely a must see if you’re in that area.\nTulum Mayan Ruins \u0026amp; Playa del Carmen Shopping Tour Combo from Riviera Maya\nfrom: Viator\nOutside of Tulum, are many little vendors selling hand crafted items, as well as performers performing little shows for the shoppers. The performers were kind of scary looking with masks and there makeup but the kids loved it.\nShopping in Riviera Maya    5th Avenue Shopping\n      5th Avenue Shopping\n    For all females and some males, shopping is a must, even if you don’t plan to buy anything. I usually don’t buy anything outside of USA (I think everything is usually ridiculously priced), but I still like to go out and check out what a city has to offer.\nWell Riviera Maya has a beautiful market place on 5th Avenue, with lots of places to eat and a strip fill of clothing to souvenir shops. It was a nice half day excursion out of the resort. We did end up buying some souvenirs though.\nThis is a brief summary of our time in Riviera Maya, it was a wonderful trip. We loved it.\n","permalink":"https://www.skytravelblogger.com/the-grand-sunset-princess-resort-in-riviera-maya-cancun/","tags":["Beach","Mexico","Resorts","Caribbean"],"title":"The Grand Sunset Princess Resort in Riviera Maya Cancun"}]
