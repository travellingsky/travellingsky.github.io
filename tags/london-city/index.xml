We highly recommend you buy these tickets beforehand for these Attractions if you plan to visit :
 Buckingham Palace Tour Kensington Palace Tour Westminster Abbey London Eye Tower of London Madam Tussaud&amp;rsquo;s St Paul’s Cathedral Book your afternoon Tea experience And which Day tour you decide to do via Viator  Transportation : The easiest mode of Transportation within London is by Underground and/or Bus.</description>
