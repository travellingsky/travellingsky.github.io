      <description>Chattanooga is a great vacation spot to get away from the busy life of the neighboring cities and states. Perfect destination especially for us who live in Atlanta because there is so much culture and so many things to do for people of all ages. The night life is great and so many great restaurants to choose from. So many places to visit from art galleries to beautiful scenic gardens and see exotic waterfalls.</description>

      <description>Sometimes it’s the last-minute trips that are so much fun. Fortunately living in Atlanta, Georgia is the perfect distance away from so many nearby states. A holiday weekend approached and deciding what we should do was a small dilemma because we only had 1 night, we could spend away due to a family event that we had committed too.</description>
