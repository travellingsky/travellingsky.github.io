      <description>Not knowing anything besides Cambridge being a College town, we were in total love with the place. Cambridge is such a beautiful historic town, with a Royal feel to it. Its almost 2 hours away by car from Heathrow Airport, it’s very compact and cozy with many little shops and boutiques. We strolled through the streets and visited so many little stores.</description>

      <description>Picking the right resort is essential when vacationing, and for us the Grand Sunset Princess Resort was perfect. We loved it so much that we recommended it to saw many people who all went there after us.
Right from the moment you walk into the foyer until the time you leave you feel like royalty. First we were greeted with a non alcoholic drink, which was nice and refreshing in the heat, before we even checked in for our room.</description>
