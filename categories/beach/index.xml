      <description>Picking the right resort is essential when vacationing, and for us the Grand Sunset Princess Resort was perfect. We loved it so much that we recommended it to saw many people who all went there after us.
Right from the moment you walk into the foyer until the time you leave you feel like royalty. First we were greeted with a non alcoholic drink, which was nice and refreshing in the heat, before we even checked in for our room.</description>
