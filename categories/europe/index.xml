      <description>Not knowing anything besides Cambridge being a College town, we were in total love with the place. Cambridge is such a beautiful historic town, with a Royal feel to it. Its almost 2 hours away by car from Heathrow Airport, it’s very compact and cozy with many little shops and boutiques. We strolled through the streets and visited so many little stores.</description>
